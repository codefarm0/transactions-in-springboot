note right
Each record is processed independently within the outer transaction.
Validation includes:
- Required fields
- Data format
- Business rules
- Duplicate checks

Success logging includes:
- Record ID
- Timestamp
- User info
- Operation type

- Outer transaction ensures atomicity
- Nested transactions for partial rollbacks
- REQUIRES_NEW for logging
- Independent record processing
- Detailed error tracking
end note
