title Scheduled Retry Flow for Failed Operations

start
:Start Retry Job;
partition Scheduler {
  repeat
    :Fetch next failed operation;
    :Begin transaction;
    if (Operation succeeds?) then (yes)
      :Mark as completed;
      :Log retry success [REQUIRES_NEW];
      :Commit;
    else (no)
      :Increment retry count;
      if (Max retries reached?) then (yes)
        :Move to dead letter table;
      endif
      :Rollback;
    endif
  repeat while (More retries?)
}
stop

note right
- Uses REQUIRES_NEW for logging to ensure
  audit trail even if main operation fails
- Dead letter table for failed operations
  after max retries
- Transaction management for each retry attempt
end note
