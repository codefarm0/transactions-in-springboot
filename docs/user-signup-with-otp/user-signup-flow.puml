title User Signup Flow with Independent Email and Logging

start
:User Signup Request;
:Begin transaction;
:Save User;
:Call sendOtpEmail() [REQUIRES_NEW];
:Call logAuditEvent() [REQUIRES_NEW];
:Commit main transaction;
stop

note right
Even if email or logging fails, user is still saved.
REQUIRES_NEW ensures these actions are isolated.
